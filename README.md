# POO_Project
The project was carried out as a team using the C ++ programming language based on object-oriented programming. The purpose of the project was to implement a limited version of a database management system, such as SQLite. Following this project, we gained advanced knowledge regarding working with text files and binary files, the use of .CSV files, and much more.
